A set of Cool Projects which I spawn when bored.

### Service Worker in PWA
Trying out custom service workers in a simple PWA(Progressive Web Application) because as Steve Jobs dreamed long ago, its the future!
Its a React Application with a CRA boilerplate, ejected to enable writing custom service worker.

### Server Side Rendering
Trying a basic application with server side rendering for ReactJS.
Again using my favorite boilerplate, CRA.

### Enron Social Graph
Tried doing a few graph algorithms on a famous data set, Enron Data Set.

# School Projects

A set of School Projects which happens when you attend "school".

The Links consist of all the readme files, because the repositories are private :wink:


### Information Retrieval
Python scripts consisting of Focussed Crawling on wikipedia. PageRank and Weighted PageRank algorithms implemented on WT2g collection. Small Search Engine using Inverted index and retrieval based on BM25 algorithm.

### Yelp Time Series Analysis

### Computer Systems
Projects done as a part of core-course Computer System.

### Fault Tolerant dmtcp
A Project done as a part of Computer Systems course.

Integrates DMTCP coordinator to work with zookeeper and makes it fault tolerant by saving the state of the current coordinator, so that standby masters can continue to checkpoint from that particular state and single point of failure for computation is avoided.

These coordinators can share the current state using Zookeeper. Leader election also happens with these znode and a common leader is choosen amongst the available dmtcp coordinators (representing znodes) with whom the worker processes talk.
